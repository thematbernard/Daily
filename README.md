# Daily

This is going to be a repository where I practice code on code wars and can upload it here for everyone to see my solutions
I will mainly be practicing in C/C++ and Python.

I want to start this project to get me used to using git to push my code onto githup and practice techniques in coding to keep me up to par with my peers.
